Wow my old one of these made me look bad

Im currently working on a game engine (for some reason I posted the first document to my old 
account). I have been programming for around six years, and I've only really been releasing stuff for 
the last three I'd say. The first game engine that I worked with was unity (I had been using scratch 
and python before this), which wasnt the best experience at the start due to my lack of an internet 
connection at the time. A year or so after my first failed attempt at a fnaf fan game and motivation 
to use unity as a whole, I came back, this time I actually had a stable internet connection and in 
grade six I released my first actual project (it was a "survival game" with almost nothing but 
eating). My biggest project ever was made in unity and is also the reason I switched to godot, this 
was a remake of my fist game ever which i made in grade 5 as a school project; This game was unicorn 
blaster, the code base became a mess and was impossible to work with after a few months, which I 
eventually realised was a consistent factor in making unity projects. Godot was nice nothing to fancy 
and was quite easy to learn (not the least due ot my experience with unity), I had a school project 
just last year around building a game in unity, which we did over ten weeks, I did most the project 
in two days because the project was designed to be for the very beginners to unity. Unity did not 
work half the time and even when it did it was slow as fuck. Godot was just a much better option for 
me. But then I got bored and for some reason every time I get bored I try and do the most stupidly 
difficult thing that I can realistically have some hope of accomplishing I made a 3d renderer using 
LearnOpenGL as a guide. Now I am working on a scripting language with the goal to make game code and 
project structure hard to fail at.
